    "# Flight Price Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for flight prices.\n",
    "Base on two datasets for two flight classes we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create clean dataset,\n",
    "- then we explore this data to investigate which factors (class, airline, booking time, etc.) have the biggest impact\n",
    "- and at the end we try to predict ticket price by creating a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate that the current date, used for predicting prices based on the time remaining until departure, is '10-02-2022' as our data is for period between february 11 and march 31 of the year 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run this\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup this project we use `./run.sh` script which should work both on Windows and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup has following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- creating Python virtual environment using `venv` (which should be preinstalled),\n",
    "- activating this environment,\n",
    "- installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` in it,\n",
    "- cleaning and preparing main dataset that will be used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Difference**: How much more do Business-class tickets cost compared to Economy?\n",
    "- **Airline Comparison**: Do ticket prices differ a lot between airlines?\n",
    "- **Last-minute Booking**: How are prices affected if you book just 1 or 2 days before departure?\n",
    "- **Timing Effects**: Does the departure or arrival time of day change ticket prices?\n",
    "- **Route Impact**: How do different source/destination cities influence price?\n",
    "- **Key Drivers**: Which features seem to influence the price the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 11 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Airline: Name of one of 8 airlines,\n",
    "- Flight: Flight code (like SG-8709),\n",
    "- Source City: Name of one of 6 cities where flight departure,\n",
    "- Departure Time: Part of the day of the departue,\n",
    "- Stops: Number of stops on the route,\n",
    "- Arrival Time: Part of the day of the arrival,\n",
    "- Destination City: Name of one of 6 cities where the flight lands.\n",
    "- Class: Ticket class: Economy or Business.\n",
    "- Duration: Total flight time in hours (numeric).\n",
    "- Days Left: How many days between the booking date and the flight date (numeric).\n",
    "- Price: Ticket price (numeric).\n",
    "\n",
    "All columns except price will be used as inputs to predict price.\n"
